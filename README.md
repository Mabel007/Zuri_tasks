# Zuri_tasks

## In this repository I'll be solving all the tasks on my Zuri Dashboard.

## Some will be done with HTML, CSS and Javascript for frontend.

## And for backend the tasks are given in python but since I want to learn PHP I will use it to solve them also.

### The first task is to recreate the design given in the png. The aim is to get a better understanding og how to use basic html tags like: main, div, h1,h3, hr,links, radio inputs etc

### Getting familiar with CSS selectors(classes and ID's), some commonly used properties, like margin, padding, border, background-color, fonts etc.

### Task 2 is to create and populate a table. The description can be found in the table.txt file. The aim is to know how to create and use table elements like thead, th, tr, td, and attributes like cell spacing, cell padding, and border. Here again I made use of css selectors and properties.

### The next task I'm solving is the tribute page. I am designing an html page that will serve as a tribute about the person i admire most. It will have a title, heading, description(detail), an img and img caption. A timeline that will be in the form of a list. A link that will lead to the biography of the tribute. And I will explore other tags like small, figcaption, strong, blockquotes and figure.
