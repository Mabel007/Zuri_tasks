# Zuri_tasks

## In this repository I'll be solving all the tasks on my Zuri Dashboard.

## Some will be done with HTML, CSS and Javascript for frontend.

## And for backend the tasks are given in python but since I want to learn PHP I will use it to solve them also.

### The first task is to recreate the design given in the png. The aim is to get a better understanding og how to use basic html tags like: main, div, h1,h3, hr,links, radio inputs etc

### Getting familiar with CSS selectors(classes and ID's), some commonly used properties, like margin, padding, border, background-color, fonts etc.
